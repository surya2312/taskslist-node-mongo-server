## Install npm packages


Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:
```bash
npm install
```

## To run the application

```bash
npm start
```

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
